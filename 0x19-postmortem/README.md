Web Stack Outage Incident

Issue Summary:Duration:Start Time: January 22, 2024, 14:00 UTC End Time: January 22, 2024, 18:30 UTC

Impact:
The outage affected our main web application server, resulting in a 30% decrease in our user accessibility.
Users experienced slow page loading times and intermittent service disruptions.

Root Cause: The root cause of the outage was identified as a misconfigured load balancer,
leading to uneven distribution of traffic and increased server load

Timeline:
 -  Detection Time: January 22, 2024, 14:15 UTC
 -  Detection Method: One of our automated monitoring alert triggered due to a sudden spike in error rates and response times
 -  Actions Taken: Our operations team had initiated an investigation into the core infrastructure components,
    focusing on servers, databases, and network connectivity.
 -  Misleading Paths: Initially, we suspected a potential DDoS attack due to the sudden surge in traffic,
    diverting resources to scrutinize security logs and implement temporary traffic filtering measures.
 -  Escalation: As the issue continued, it was escalated to the system architecture team to assess the
    load balancing configuration and its impact on overall system stability.
 -  Resolution: After identifying the misconfigured load balancer as the primary culprit, the system architecture team promptly corrected the
    configuration and monitored the system for any signs of recovery.

Root Cause:
The misconfiguration in the load balancer settings resulted in unequal distribution of incoming traffic
across the application servers. This caused certain servers to be overloaded, leading to increased
response times and intermittent service failures.

Resolution:
The configuration settings of the load balancer were adjusted to evenly distribute
traffic among the available application servers. This was followed by a thorough testing
phase to ensure proper functionality and stability.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:
Schedule regular reviews of load balancer configurations to prevent future misconfigurations. Strengthen monitoring systems
to promptly detect and alert on irregularities in server loads and response times. Develop a comprehensive plan for handling potential
DDoS attacks to differentiate them from legitimate traffic more effectively.

Task List:
- Task the system architecture team to conduct an immediate audit of all load balancer configurations
  to identify and rectify any discrepancies.
- Implement additional monitoring checks to track server loads, response times, and traffic patterns more accurately.
- Collaborate with the security team to establish a robust DDoS mitigation plan, including traffic filtering measures
  and communication protocols.

The reasearch done in this provided valuable insights into the importance of regular configuration audits,
robust monitoring, and proactive planning for potential security threats. These measures aim to fortify our web stack against
similar issues in the future, ensuring a more resilient and reliable user experience.
